* Introduction:
- Used for automation.
- Has two main components,
  + Control node: Main computer using which you manage resources.
  + Manged nodes: Client nodes that you manage using the control node.
- Uses SSH for linux and WinRM for windows for communication.
- Is agentless. So no need to install any additional software on the managed nodes.

* Tasks and playbooks:
- Task refers to a single operation you have to perform on a managed node.
- Tasks are executed in the order they're written.
- Plays are a ordered collection of tasks.
- Roles are a variable like names use to bundle a group of tasks, variables, hosts, etc, so that they can be reused.
- Inventory is a file (or multiple files or even a directory containing multiple files) that contains the information about the managed nodes.
- You use .ini or .yaml format to write inventory files.
